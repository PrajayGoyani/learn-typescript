TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing. This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types. TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
